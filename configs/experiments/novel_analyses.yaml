  name: "novel_perception_vs_imagery"
  description: >
    Comprehensive analysis of perception-to-imagery transfer including
    dimensionality gap, uncertainty-vividness, semantic survival,
    topological RSA, and cross-subject imagery fingerprints.

# Which analyses to run (all ten directions)
analyses:
  - dimensionality       # Direction 1: The Dimensionality Gap
  - uncertainty          # Direction 2: Uncertainty as Vividness
  - semantic             # Direction 3: Semantic Survival
  - topology             # Direction 4: Topological RSA
  - cross_subject        # Direction 5: Cross-Subject Imagery Fingerprint
  - dissociation         # Direction 6: Semantic-Structural Dissociation
  - reality_monitor      # Direction 7: Computational Reality Monitor
  - confusion_mapping    # Direction 8: Reality Confusion Mapping
  - adversarial_reality  # Direction 9: Adversarial Reality Probing
  - hierarchical_reality # Direction 10: Hierarchical Reality Gradient
